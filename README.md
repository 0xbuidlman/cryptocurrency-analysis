## About

Having followed the cryptocurrency market for a while now, I decided to do some exploring in the data available from [coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com).
Especially in light of the ever increasing number of successful coins and [decreasing Bitcoin dominance in terms of market capitalisation](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#btc-percentage), I assume many investors are eager to understand the dynamics of this market.

## Progress

This is a work in progress. Steps taken so far:

1. Obtain and clean data from [coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com) using [coinmarketcap-scraper](https://github.com/prouast/coinmarketcap-scraper)

2. Calculate daily returns for each coin

Example:
